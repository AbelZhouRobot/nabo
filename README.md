# A biped control framework "nabo" (小炮)

Nabo, whose Chinese name (小炮) means a Naughty Boy, which is after the movie 《老炮儿》(Mr. Six) directed by Guan Hu, respecting to the fearless temperament of the advancing times.

Nabo uses a traditional centroid MPC algorithm with pure c++, it has TWO advantages:

**1. Easy to deploy**

Nabo is developed in c++, it has the features of **Crossing OS, Crossing Platform, Self-Dependent, and Easy for Deployment**. It can run on Windows or Linux with Mujoco, Webots, Coppelia, Gazebo, or even real robot. The structure of nabo is shown below. The blocks in gray are not accomplished.

**2. Easy to read and develop**

The MIT Cheetah is an impressive program, but it is not friendly for rookies to start. Nabo uses **No Fly Pointers, Good Modulation, Low Nesting Layers, and Lite Release**, making it readable for humans and effective for methines.

Nabo is not fully developed, now it only can walk in simulation (Feb. 2024).
